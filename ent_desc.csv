Answers to some common questions:

1) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.
2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I created Digital Dudz (made some videos about this too) and eventually sold it after 2 years.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years.  As of 2019, I just make my monthly YouTube videos.
3) Link to free and therefore substandard build plans for my custom workbench can be found below.
4) I made a 30 Day Creative Engineering Class that teaches my end to end engineering process so you can make stuff too!  Check it out here- https://monthly.com/MarkRober"

StuffMadeHere,"I've been building things for as long as I can remember. It all started when my dad exposed me to plastic model building and soldering when I was around 4 years old. That set me on a path to building increasingly complex things and becoming an engineer. My goal is to do the same for as many people as possible by exposing them to the joy of engineering, fabricating and creating things out of nothing. If I'm lucky a few people may become engineers, which would be great for the world. Engineering is awesome.

HangingPawns,"Update: current ELO 1911
Hanging Pawns is a chess channel for players who are trying to improve (by a player who is trying to improve). 
I am a chess player who has started his career late by any standards. I played my first rated tournament game when I was 26, eighteen months ago. Since then I have decided to dedicate my life and my time to chess, and to make it possible to travel to tournaments and to have enough money and time to do so. My ultimate goal is to work daily until I become a GM, which will surely take years to accomplish. All the games I play, how I prepare for my opponents and the methods I use to improve and to learn will be posted on this channel! 
My current ELO is 1770. I hope you find something useful here and that you get to improve your chess as well! Cheers!
