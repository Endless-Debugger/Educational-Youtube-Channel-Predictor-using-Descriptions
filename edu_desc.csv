Since I was young I've dreamed of being able to witness the next big milestone. We've seen no further manned missions outside Low Earth Orbit in my years, but this is about to change with SpaceX and Blue Origin pushing humanity back into the new space race alongside NASA. Other wonderful new companies such as Rocketlab are increasing the excitement with smaller payloads as well. This is an amazing time to be alive and I want to share all I can with you. Historically I'm a huge fan of Kerbal Space Program (KSP) which is where my Youtube channel started. KSP2 is around the corner, so we may well get back into that at some point soon as well."
